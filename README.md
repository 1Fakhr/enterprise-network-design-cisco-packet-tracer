# Enterprise Network Design – Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains an academic enterprise network design project created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates foundational networking and security concepts commonly used in real-world environments.

## Project Overview
- Designed a multi-router, multi-switch enterprise network
- Implemented VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing
- Configured OSPF for dynamic routing
- Applied security controls including:
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Port Security
  - DHCP Snooping
  - Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- Configured secure device access using passwords and SSH
- Analyzed ARP behavior and applied spoofing mitigation techniques

## Files Included
- `project.pkt` – Cisco Packet Tracer project file
- `topology.png` – Network topology screenshot
- `project-documentation.pdf` – Detailed project explanation and design decisions

## Notes
Some technologies (such as full VPN implementation) are limited by the simulation environment of Cisco Packet Tracer and are documented conceptually.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking and security fundamentals
